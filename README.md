# CurrencyConverter
Fancy currency converter app for android. 

Edge cases considered while developing the app:
1. If user select a currency and internet goes, calculate all currencies based on last updated data.
2. Show user their last selected preference or currency data. 
3. If user select EUR currency but no internet and they select another currency immediately what happens then. 
4. Cache last currency data to show it for user to guess instead of showing nothing.
